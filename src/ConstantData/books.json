Not only is it full of great BBQ tips and recipes, but it has great appetizer ideas, cocktails, salads and deserts. They are all unique and the ones I have tried have been simple, delicious and fun. We really enjoyed the pimento cheese and the King Street Corn. Summer Grilling season can not come soon enough.",

I did not, at first, understand why this book was selected, but after reading the first few chapters I got it. We are part of nature, and the author knows it, feels it and is able to express the wonder of it. The book reads easy, flowing from topic to topic. At the end of each chapter I felt that I had learned something new, and often something amazing. I won't give it away - but I was particularly stunned by the chapter about starlings. I believe this is a book anyone would enjoy.",

The hard graft at the bench, the flashes of inspiration, the importance of conferences as cauldrons of creativity, the rivalry, sometimes friendly, sometimes less so, and the sense of common purpose are all conveyed in his narrative. The Code Breaker describes a dance to the music of time with these things as its steps, which began with Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel and shows no sign of ending.",
